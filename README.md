# rdp_algorithm
Haskell implementation of the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker split and merge algorithm

This is the first "real world" application I've written in Haskell a month after starting to learn the language and its concepts.
It is a direct implemantation of the algorithm listed [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramer%E2%80%93Douglas%E2%80%93Peucker_algorithm).
